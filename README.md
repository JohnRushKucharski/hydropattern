# hydropattern
Finds natural flow regimes type patterns in time series data.

## Background
Natural flow regimes are widely used in water resources management. Learn more about natural flow regimes:

The repository tends to use functional flows terminology. Functional flows are natural flow regimes linked to specific environmental processes. Learn more about functional flows:

A functional flows approach to selecting ecologically relevant flow metrics for environmental flow applications. River Research and Applications, 36(2), 318-324. https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.3575

> Note: Figure 2 and Table 2 are particularly helpful for understanding the natural flow regimes this program tracks.

Natural flow regimes can be adapted to classify hydrologic regimes in non-riverine environments, like static water levels in lakes. They can be used to evaluate the alteration of natural hydrologic patterns. This program imagines their usage in climate impact studies.

## Basic Terminology
To define a natural flow regime the following hierarchical labels must be defined:

**Component:** Natural flow regimes consist of one or more *components*.

**Characteristic:** Each component consists of one or more of the following *characteristics*.

- Timing: when the hydrologic pattern occurs (i.e., wet season).
- Magnitude: the size hydrologic pattern (i.e., flow, stage, etc.).
- Duration: how long the hydrologic pattern persists (i.e., 7 days).
- Frequency: how often the pattern occurs (i.e. in 1 out of every 5 years).
- Rate of Change: change in the size of the hydrologic pattern (i.e., doubling of the previous day's flow).

**Metric:** A metric defines the truth value for each characteristic. For example, the magnitude of flow > 100.

Examples are provided below.

## Getting Started
The program can be used as either: (a) python package, imported from the project GitHub repository: https://github.com/JohnRushKucharski/hydropattern or the PiPl python package index. (b) a command line application.

#todo: fill out setup instructions.

### Inputs
The program requires two primary inputs:

1. A .toml configuration file. This file must contain the following sections:

    a. **[timeseries]**: in this section the *path* variable provides the location of the .csv timeseries input file, described below. The optional *date_format* variable is used to provide the timeseries datetime format code, see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior. By default pandas will, with a warning message and possible error, attempt to guess format of this string, if not date format is provided. The optional *first_day_of_water_year* is used to distinguish between water and calendar years, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_year. By default, the water and calendar year are assumed be the same (i.e., first_day_of_water_year = 1). The optional *columns* parameter tells the program which columns in the timeseries .csv contain hydrologic data. By default only the first time, and first column are read (i.e., columns = [1]). 

    b. **[components]**: in this section components, characteristics, and metrics are provided.
    
The toml configuration file follows basic toml file syntax (see: https://toml.io/en/). A minimal example can be found in the project GitHub repository at .\examples\minimal.toml. A more complete example file with extensive instructions and comments can be found at .\examples\detailed.toml.

2. One or more hydrologic time series provided in a .csv file. This file must have the following format:

time    | column_0      | column_1  | ... | column_n-1  | column_n      |
---     | ---           | ---       | --- | ---         | ---           | 
t_0     | value_0,0     | value_1,0 | ... | value_n-1,0 | value_n,0     |
t_1     | value_0,1     | ...       | ... | ...         | value_n,1     |
...     | ...           | ...       | ... | ...         | ...           |         
t_m-1   | value_0,m-1   | ...       | ... | ...         | value_n,m-1   |
t_m     | value_0,m     | value_1,m | ... | value_n-1,m | value_n,m     |

where the 'time' column contains a datetimestring that can be parsed as a pandas datetime index. By default pandas will, with a warning message and possible error, attempt to guess format of this string. However, the format of this string can be specified in the toml file, described above. Example time series are provided in the .\examples directory on the project's GiHub repository.

## CLI Basic Usage
#todo: run command

todo: plot_timeseries command
